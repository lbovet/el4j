==
  All binary modules are working only with EL4Ant 0.9.1 and special plugins of
  EL4J. J2EE plugin of EL4Ant must be replaced with the EL4J one.
==

* Framework modules
  = module-core (binary verison is 1.1)
    + BeanTypeAutoProxyCreator for autoproxying beans based on their type.
    + JNDI property override and placeholder configurers used to adapt the
      configuration by values retrieved through JNDI.
    + Application context that resolves resources based on manifest file items
      (LeafApplicationContext has been moved to ModuleApplicationContext).
    + Coding support classes added. Only parts which are not covered by spring
      classes were added.
    + Implicit context passing generalized. Get and pushed context must now be 
      an object.
    + Business exceptions has been deprecated. Subclasses of DataAccessException
      must now be used. Only the InsertionFailureException is written by EL4J
      others are from the spring framework.
    + Useful notification methods added in CoreNotificationHelper, like the the 
      one to notify a misconfiguration. Should be used in afterPropertiesSet 
      method for example.
    + Convenience dao class added for Ibatis SqlMaps.
    + Abstract dtos are now solved with integer as optimistic locking version 
      and integer or string as primary key.
    + Support added for easy creation of an own intercepter. Interception is
      configurated by using commons attributes.
    + Interface enrichment can now handle also methods with arrays.
  = module-core-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests added for new features.
    + Adapted to EL4Ant.

    + Integration tests for module-core.
    + Tests added for new features.
    
  = module-daemon_manager (binary verison is 1.0)
    + Used to manage deamons. Inspired from orchestra thread manager. Each 
      demaon belongs to a demaon manager which starts and stops them. Demaons
      can be executed periodically or with a defined sleep time inbetween.
  = module-daemon_manager-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-daemon_manager.
  = module-daemon_manager-demos (no binary version)
    + Demo for module-daemon_manager.
  
  = module-env (binary verison is 1.0)
    + Used to replace place holders in configuration files with the environment
      defined through EL4Ant.
  = module-env-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-env.
  
  = module-exception_handling (binary verison is 1.0)
    + Interceptor to handle exceptions.
    + Configurable handler hierarchy.
    + Safety facade to handle implementation-specific exceptions.
    + Context exception handler to handle exceptions depending on the current context.
    + Provides default handler strategies (retry, transform, log, rethrow).
  = module-exception_handling-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-exception_handling.
  
  = module-executable_distribution-demos (no binary version)
    + Demonstrates the use of executable distributions.
  
  = module-jmx (binary verison is 1.1)
    + Used to support developpers in debugging code by providing a real time 
      view of the beans and their configurations.
  = module-jmx-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-jmx.
  
  = module-light_statistics (binary verison is 1.0)
    + Interceptor to measure invocation times.
  = module-light_statistics-demos (no binary version)
    + Demo for module-light_statistics.
  
  = module-remoting_and_interface_enrichment (binary verison is 1.1)
    + Soap support added. Also context passing to Leaf2 is possible.
  = module-remoting_and_interface_enrichment-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for soap added.
    + Tests improved.
  = module-remoting_and_interface_enrichment-demos (no binary version)
    + Soap added to benchmark.
  
  = module-remoting_ejb (binary verison is 1.0)
    + Wraps POJOs into session beans (stateful or stateless).
  = module-remoting_ejb-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-remoting_ejb

  = module-security
    + Besides the Acegi Security System library, this module contains an 
      AuthenticationServiceContextPasser and an AuthenticationService which 
      allows the user to transparently log in to a server and transparently 
      invoke the server's methods.
  = module-security-tests (no binary version)
    + Tests for module-security.
    
  = module-web (binary verison is 1.1)
    + Web application context that resolves resources based on manifest file
      items.
    + Convenience classes added.


* Framework plugins
  = remoting_ejb
    + Generates EJB wrappers for POJOs.
    + Supports JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere.
  = environment
    + Adds support for environments.
  = parallel
    + Executes existing targets in parallel.
  = distribution
    + Adds support for creating executable distributions without EL4Ant 
      dependencies.
  = j2ee
    + EL4Ant j2ee plugin must be replaced with our j2ee plugin to have
      environment support.
