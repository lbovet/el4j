---+ Abstract
EL4J, the Extension Library for the J2EE, adds incremental improvements to the 
Spring Java framework (http://www.springframework.org/).

---+ License
For the time being, EL4J is published under the GPL 
(see file "etc/License.txt").

We also have plans to try to submit parts of EL4J as contribution to the Spring 
framework. Should these be accepted as such, they will of course be made 
available under the Apache licence as used by Spring. 

---+ Version
For current release notes see file "etc/ReleaseNotes.txt".

---+ Getting started
Code and documentation of the EL4J J2EE framework can be found on 
"http://el4j.sourceforge.net". Please look at file "etc/GettingStarted.txt" for 
further information.
