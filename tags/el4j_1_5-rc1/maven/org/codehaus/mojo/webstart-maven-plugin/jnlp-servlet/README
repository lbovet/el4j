jnlp-servlet taken out from Sun's mustang.

I wasn't sure of the version numbering.
I wanted to keep a reference on the build number used by Sun in the version number. Is it an issue?

Note: I just moved the compile code into src/main/resources as a quick hack. Of course I should move the code into src/main/... instead.
