/**
 * States an assumption made by the annotated element's implementation.
 * Assumptions are statements that are considered true for the purpose of
 * writing code but whose truth is unknown.
 *
 * <p>The long term vision is that an automatic tool can process the source
 * code to collect the assumptions made, permitting efficient review in case
 * requirements change. Even in the absence of such a tool, source code
 * information systems such as eclipse can efficiently search assumptions.
 *
 * <p> Assumption bear some similarity with "to do" items, but differ
 * in that they are conditional: An assumption only needs to be removed if it is
 * false. In contrast, a "to do" item needs to be taken care of unconditionally.
 *
 * <p>Assumptions that can easily be formulated as Java expressions should be
 * stated as assertions/preconditions instead (to enable runtime checking).
 *
 * <p>Assumptions document code, not behavior, and are therefore not included
 * in the API documentation. Like comments, they are discarded by the compiler.
 *
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 *  <pre>
 *  &#64;assumes("the name uniquely identifies a person")
 *  Object getKey() {return this.name;}
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  <script type="text/javascript">printFileStatus
 *   ("$URL$",
 *    "$Revision$",
 *    "$Date$",
 *    "$Author$"
 * );</script>
