RefDbGui Tiger
==============

Purpose
-------

The demo aims to provide a lightweight configuration interface to Spring RCP by leveraging the information contained in the Domain Object Model.


Design Goals
------------

- Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.
	
	Every gui element features a settings-based configuration interface. Whenever possible, default settings are derived from the DOM. If these are approapriate,
	no further action needs to be taken, otherwise, the settings can be overridden individually. If the desired behavior can not be expressed using settings alone, the user	can subclass generic elements or write his own.
	
	A speciality is that even behavior can be expressed using settings to some extent since some settings actually hold snippets of code (written by the user or taken from the library). For instance, to wire a search form to a table view, you simply tell the table view that its filter is the search view's query.

Design considerations
---------------------

It is nearly an industry standard to specify configuration in XML. We chose to use Java because Java IDEs provide much better support at development time (code completion, type checks, ...) and code snippets can be inlined into configuration settings (no need to put a 3 line method in a seperate file). We feel that these considerations outweigh the disadvantage that the GUI configuration can only be adjusted in the presence of a compiler.


Maturity (or lack thereof ;) )
------------------------------

To accelerate the construction of this prototype, we have concentrated on the configuration interface. To present a working prototype, backing support is simulated using the refdb's persistence logic. This dependency will be removed at a later time. 

We have yet to provide the full capabilities of refdb; the impossibility to create/delete entities is particularly annoying.
