/**
 * Provides an abstraction for all Mojos that are capable of signing
 * jar files. Most use cases will involve signing jars with the keytool
 * provided with the java development kit. However, a particular enterprise
 * may require a different method of signing jars.
 * 
 * In a corporate environment, PCs typically have a company certificate
 * installed so that applications like Java Webstart know that when
 * code is signed by the company certificate it can be trusted. Companies
 * don't want to expose this certificate's private key to individual
 * developers. Instead, the company needs to keep the key secret and provide
 * a customised way of developers submitting jar files to be signed.
 * 
 * This interface allows enterprise users to develop a Mojo which doesn't
 * use the java keytool to sign jars. For example, the Maven Webstart
 * plugin signs jars as part of its operation. Using this interface, the
 * Webstart plugin is able to use pluggable jar signers (although it will
 * use JarSignMojo as a default) so that the user can plug in a custom
 * Mojo to sign their jars.
