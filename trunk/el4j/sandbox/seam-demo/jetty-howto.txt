You now can use jetty and its hot deployment features for a improved roundtrip.

In order to do this, jump to the war folder and simply type
> mvn jetty:run

If you want to start/prepare the database first, you can use
> mvn db:start jetty:run
or
> mvn db:prepare jetty:run

But it is recommended that you control the database from another console using
> mvn db:start db:block
or
> mvn db:prepare db:block
before executing jetty:run like explained above.

The application is available under http://localhost:8080/seam-demo-war/ .

Whenever a file in the seam-demo-jar or seam-demo-war project is changed, the changes are detected and the application is updated on the server.
