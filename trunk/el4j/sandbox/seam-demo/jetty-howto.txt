You now can use jetty and its hot deployment features for a improved roundtrip.

In order to do this, jump to the war folder.

To run the app simply type
> mvn jetty:run

The database is started  automatically.

The application is available under http://localhost:8080/seam-demo .

Whenever a file in the seam-demo-jar or seam-demo-war project is changed, the changes are detected and the application is updated on the server.
