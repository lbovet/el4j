<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This guide was taken from the Spring RCP Example and modified to the needs of this Demo. It gives a general introduction to the rich client platform</p>
<p>This application provides a very simple introduction to the 
Spring Richclient platform. It is intended to highlight the common
models for working with the platform (including configuration and run-time access to platform services) and how to
organize the basic pieces of an application using the platform.</p>
<p>This sample provides an implementation of a master detail. The focus of the demo is how to work with the Spring 
Rich platform, not about how to build a fancy gui.</p>
<p>Other samples, like the ones from Spring RCP, will introduce more complex topics like user management (security),
alternate page/view layouts, complex data binding, remoting, etc.</p>
<p>The Spring Rich platform relies on the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>
project to manage the application context with all the associated benefits it offers.</p>
<p>A start at the Spring Rich Client documentation can be found on the
<a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/RCP/Home">wiki</a>.</p>
