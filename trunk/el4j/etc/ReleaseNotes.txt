* SourceForge Change Requests CLOSED:
  1523763 - throw more specific exception in ConvenienceHibernateTemplate

* Core
  = Simplified handling of data access: 
    + Better QueryObject pattern support for Hibernate with real OR- and NOT-Queries, simple paging
	   (loading all entries in batches of maximal N elements) and sorting support
    + More convention over configuration: Autocollected @Entity classes (Hibernate), automatically
  	   colleted DAOs (DAOs are added to the spring application context and to the DAORegistry), 
	   automatically injected SessionFactory and SqlMapClientTemplate, automatically determined type
	   T of GenericDao<T> classes
    + The newly added feature are backward compatible
	+ Dao registry now handles spring proxied classes also correctly (idea from Ky)
	+ New FallbackDaoRegistry (alternative implementation to DefaultDaoRegistry): If no DAO can be
   	  found for an entityType, a generic DAO is created
  = Simplified and homogenized multi-environment support
    + Helps with properties shared between Maven and Spring: they are only defined once and
	  they are available both in Maven (during build/ launch time) and Spring (during run time).
	+ We have added 2 new configuration files:
	   env-placeholder.properties and env-bean-property.properties. The former
	   is for Spring placeholders (of the form ${placeholder-name}), the latter is for
	   renaming of beans (for the Spring PropertyOverrideConfigurer).
    + Db properties are now defined in the pom.xml files and the new environment property file
  	 (env-bean-property.properties). Changing the database to use is now made by enabling the
	 corresponding profile (no setting of system property db.name allowed!). Refer to the FAQ
	 for more information on how to change your profile.
	+ The web context string is now also handled via the environment support.
	+ The new support is backward compatible.
	+ Please refer to the corresponding plugin documentation for details.
  = Added AopHelper with easy programmatic interceptor/mixin addition.
  = Upgrade to Spring 2.5.1  
  = Clean ups (less warnings, unneeded dependency removed, fixed some inconsistencies in 
    naming and documentation) and improved documentation
  = Added 2 helper methods to check for a certain JDK version 
  = We have added a file "etc/KnownIssues.txt" that we keep up to dates with small short 
    term issues of EL4J. We make the file's version of the Subversion trunk available on the EL4J
	website.
  = The file etc/m2/settings.xml has been updated (we added mostly just commented-out 
    sections so that you have an example in case you want to enable some functionality)
  = The RefreshPropertyOverrideConfigurer no more needed due to a fix in ModuleAppCtxs. See
    http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4378

* Remoting
  = Upgrade to Hessian 3.1.3
  = Burlap is now deprecated (it is no more supported by caucho.com)
  = Upgrade to jax-ws-commons 1.8
	
* Databases
  = Upgraded to new Derby JDBC driver. Advantage: it can be freely distributed.
  = Upgraded to newest oracle driver
	
* Build system
  = Upgrade to new maven 2.0.8
  = Introduced recursive maven "mvnrec" (recursively build the current module and 
     all modules it requires). Please refer to the documentation of the corresponding 
	 maven plugin.
  = We added artificial versions to all required external maven plugin snapshots. Benefit:
     be no longer dependent on external parties.
  = Added shell scripts for Windows (.bat files).
  = Improvements of the dependency graph plugin: use maven mechanism to collect information
     (this fixes some issues). One can now also show the type of dependencies on edges of the 
	 graph.
  = Database plugin: The delimiter of SQL statements can now be changed. This is used i.e. with
    PL/SQL code where the delimiter is normally "/" instead of a ";".
  = We have set up some more report plugins (PMD and CPD).
  = There is a demo for the maven assembly plugin that allows to publish your application as
    a single jar (refer to module applications/templates/gui/standalone-client).
  
* New JSF module based on Facelets 1.1.14, JSF 1.2 (RI), Richfaces 3.1.4.GA and Seam 2.0.1
   (beta quality)
  = Basic module (module JSF) with libraries and simplified generic DAO support.
  = JSF Application Template that demonstrates the use of JSF.
  = Please refer to the documentation of the reference document and the application
    template.
  = We recommend to use Jetty (as replacement for Tomcat) for the development as it allows
    faster round-trips: you typically do not need to redeploy changes in your code or xhtml
	files, jetty takes them up automatically.
  = There is a new facility to test your JSF interactions (based on TestNG and Seam support). 
    Refer to the sample test.

* Modules for GUI development
  = Swing module
   + Beans binding 1.2.1 added (we use a slightly patched version)
   + Small documentation upgrades
  = Module Spring RCP
   + This module is deprecated (too little momentum of the project and too few uses of it)  
  = We have removed the old Tiger GUI demo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Date :   14.12.07
                            EL4J version  1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Core
  = Base log4j configuration added as log4j.properties file. If a project would 
    like to overwrite this default configuration, a log4j.xml must be used, (xml 
    file has precedence over properties file).
  = Upgraded to Spring 2.5, Hibernate 3.2.5.ga, Tomcat 6 and WebLogic 10.
  = Apache Commons Attributes not supported anymore
    (replaced by Java 5 Annotations)
  = Beanshell module added: it launches a Java/bsh expression from command line
    during runtime. This allows to get further info about a running application.
	A sample use (see reference doc) is to allow a remote shell to a JVM.
  = The Reject (light precondition checking) class supports now all subclasses 
    of RuntimeException. Further some convenience methods where added.
  = Added possibility to log basic application context startup parameters
    (via special logger "el4j.debugging" and level "debug").
  = A lot of small cleanups and XML validation (checkstyle checks, Spring 2-style 
    configs, better use of Hibernate annotations, documentation clarifications, ...)

* New Swing GUI Framework
  = New module Swing and Swing-demo added. It improves the Swing programming model
    with various little helper classes and a very light application framework.
  = Among the new features: Binding of POJOs to Swing components, Event Bus,
    Docking and MDI support, Exception handling, i18n and resource management,
	user preference management, simple way to define Actions and selectively enable
	them, convenience code to simplify the design of forms, ...
  = Please refer to the documentation (reference document) and the demo application.
  = This Swing GUI Framework replaces the old GUI framework based on Spring RCP.

* New webservice stack (beta quality)
  = Support for the Spring POJO programming model with sun's JAX-WS web service stack.
    It can use the same Java service interface on the client and server side
	(typically with JAX-WS you generate a new service interface on the client side,
	to improve the isolation between client and server). This JAX-WS stack does n't
	work on WebLogic 10 yet.
  = With this step we deprecate the dated Axis 1 web service stack (called module-soap).
  
* Maven 
  = Simplification of the mvn db plugin (now the property file does not need to
    be explicitly set (simplifies when launching plugin goals in isolation)).
  = Better WTP platform support of maven eclipse plugin. Support for 
    <reactorProjectGroupIdPrefixes> config to ensure certain project links
	are always local ( http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MECLIPSE-334 ).
  = Rework of the maven concept presentation
  = Prototyping with webstart maven plugin
  = Updated versions of external maven plugins: maven-source-plugin 2.0.4,
    maven-javadoc-plugin 2.2
  
* Seam demo
  = There is an experimental seam (a web framework based on JSF and JPA) demo
    refer to external/sandbox/seam-demo.
  
* Varia
  = Generation of the new EL4J convenience zip automated (via "mvn clean install" 
     under  "external/maven/helpers/packer").

                            EL4J version  1.1.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* SourceForge Change Requests CLOSED:
 1684819 -  maven-depgraph-plugin
 1523763 -  throw more specific exception in ConvenienceHibernateTemplate

* Build system
  = Upgrade to new Maven 2.0.7, upgrade to many new maven plugins, re-applied
     the patches that were still not applied to the version.
  = Cleaned up convenience zip (supports now also Unix, more generic handling
     of paths)
  = In the database maven plugin, we renamed db:prepareDB  and db:cleanUpDB to 
     db:prepare  and db:cleanUp, respectively. The old plugin names are still 
     usable but deprecated. Added db:block for unconditionaly blocking.
     Better error signaling. Silent drop is now more silent.
  = Log4j configuration solved more homogeneously (see EL4J tracing stack
     document). Fixed issue in Smart*Appenders. SmartDailyRollingFileAppender
     is now in standard log4j config files.
  = Removed many duplicated jar files from the execution paths (mainly
     by using the same maven ids (group and artefact id) as the others).
  = Cleaned up the EL4J archetype
  = Manifest plugin has less verbose log output.


* Core 
  = Upgraded to Spring 2.0.6 and many new dependent libraries (Hibernate,
     most jakarta commons, Jamon, Tomcat, Struts, ...)
  = Fixing many small configuration issues with Spring: the problems with 
     environment configurations (env.properties) are now resolved. (Hack
     to define -Ddb.name=db2 on JVM command line is no longer needed). With 
     this fix, the configuration issues of the GUI demo application are 
     resolved.
  = New Exception chain interceptor: avoid deserialisation issues
     when after a remote invocation call an exception is missing in the client's
     CLASSPATH (contributed by Reto Fankhauser)
  = 

* Database
  = Support for mysql in database module and in demos.
  
* Documentation
  = General documentation update (FAQ, Reference Document, ...)
  = New MavenCheatSheet with useful commands for the EL4J context
  = New EL4J tracing stack document (concentrates in one place many ideas to 
     figure out what is going on in an application)
  = Updated many parts of the website
  = Readme file updates
  
* Varia
  = Added experimental spring RCP 0.3 demo in sandbox/springRcpDemo
  = Clean ups of detailed statistics module
  = Added experimental el4j-seam release under sandbox/el4j-seam 
     (is still being improved)
  = XML merger tests can now run without the network

* Maven and build scripts
  = Many clean-ups in the build infrastructure and in the file organization
  = Added a database plugin that allows to execute SQL scripts on the database.
     It can optionally launch an embedded database (Derby for now).
  = Added a dependency plugin that illustrates the dependencies between modules
     graphically.
  = Added a basic EL4J archetype to get started more easily
  = We provide a mechanim to override the configuration files that are in
     the automatic Tomcat download (files etc/tomcat are copied to Tomcat).
  = Test run now in the maven integration phase (in order for us to launch
     the database in the right moment).
  = Some issues in the site-generation were fixed.
  = Added an experimental version plugin that checks whether there are new 
     versions available of existing maven plugins or of other jar-files a 
     project depends on.

  = We worked on a better Spring RCP demo (currently this is an emerging 
     prototype) 
  
* Varia
  = The remoting benchmark has been moved out of the standard EL4J tests
     (it did not fail even if there was a problem). This saves some time at 
     each build.
  = The number of exceptions thrown during a normal test run was significantly
     reduced.   
  = We resolved some build issues that occured under linux
  = We fixed a thread leak (due to incorrect resource releasing during Spring
     shutdown)
  = Upgrade to Spring 2.0.2 and some of its required tools.
  = Upgrade to Tomcat 5.5.20.

    + Further checks adapted for Java5.
  = All module dependencies moved to newest versions

* Documentation
  = Datasheet about EL4J
  = Maven tutorial presentation
  = Cheat sheets for annotations
  = Updated reference documentation
  = Created a list of unique EL4J features
  = IdentityFixer article
  = Blog
  
* Framework modules
  = module-core
    + Moved to Spring 2.0.
    + Added methods that permit to customize the exception thrown in case a precondition is violated.
    + Codingsupport now contains a package for standard code annotations.
    + Added annotations for implementation assumptions and API preliminarity.
    + Generic observer pattern support added (mainly for spring_rcp).
    + Lists utilities added.
    + Generic DAO and service parts added.
    + Live value support added (mainly for spring_rcp).
    + Commons Attributes are now marked as deprecated.
    + Meta data support added. This covers Commons Attributes and Java5 Annotations. It simplifies the association of annotations with interceptors.
    + Support for intelligent auto proxy creators added. Intelligent means that a bean is not proxied multiple times if two auto proxy creators are used.
    + ModuleApplicationContext and ModuleWebApplicationContext improved so requested resources will always be fetched in the correct order.
    + Identity fixer repository added (for spring_rcp).
    + Intelligent i18n support added (for spring_rcp).
    + DOM concept introduced (use generic DAO, make service layer sometimes optional).
    + Log4j file appenders support relative paths (relative paths are interpreted relative to a global el4j-log directory system property) 

  = module-spring-rcp
    + IncludeSearchItem class added to the spring-rcp module.
    + Refactoring: Introduced AbstractViewDescriptor.
    + Made module spring_rcp more generic and updated it to current Spring RCP codebase.
    + Discontinued use of raw types in AbstractSearchItem, added dynamic type checks to setInitialValue.
    + A demo for the new spring-rcp code is in the sandbox
    + Components became more flexible.

  = module-remoting_core
    + New protocol HttpInvoker added.
    + Pre-instantate exporter object if factory is singleton (like it was made in Spring 1.2.x). Previously this was made only for protocol rmi, now this is the default behaviour for all protocols.
    + Load balancing protocol added.

  = module-hibernate
    + Renamed classes to be convenient with module-core parts.
    + Generic DAO added.

  = module-ibatis
    + Generic DAO added.

  = module-jmx
    + Added support for thread info, get info about
      interceptors
    + Added log4j support: get active appenders,
      add and remove appenders during runtime,
      change root and logger log levels
    + Correct visual things
    + All threads are now daemon threads
    
  = module-webtest added.
    + Support tests of web GUIs

  = module-tcp_forwarder added.
    + Support testing of network connection issues.
  
  = module-xml_merge added.
    + Pragmatic merge of XML files. Please refer to the documentation.

  = module-remoting-xfire added.
    + support this new soap stack

  = module-daemon_manager moved into internal EL4J repository.

  = module-database (was common-database):
    + Automatic import of raw db config file removed.

* Applications (Keyword and RefDB):
    + Commons attributes replaced by Java5 annotations.
    + Hibernate and IBatis stuff better splitted up.
    + The distributed RefDB gui uses now HttpInvoker instead of Hessian.
    + DTO concept replaced by the DOM concept.

* Issues
    + When running the tests, there are some log outputs that seem to indicate errors. This is due to the fact that some external components log these problems while we make some tests. Mostly our tests try out special behavior that causes the external components to consider it an error.
    List of problems:
      * Hibernate StaleObjectStateException due to us provoking a db error
      * Connection error due to TCP tests or load-balancing tests
      * A file with {db.name} in its name is not found: this is due to a strange issue with Spring post bean processors (setting -Ddb.name=db on the JVM-level makes it 'disappear').
