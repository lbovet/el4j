Overview

  EL4J, the Extension Library for the J2EE, adds incremental improvements to
  the Spring Java framework ({{http://www.springframework.org/}}).

  Among the improvements are:
    * Template applications to get rapidly started
  
    * The ability to split applications in modules
    
      * A module can consist of code, jar-files and configurations with 
        transitive dependencies
        
      * A module can automatically enable its spring configuration when 
        it is present in the CLASSPATH
        
    * Simplified and more homogenized remoting
    
      * Remote a POJO as SLSB or SFSB, remote a POJO via SOAP
      
      * Optional implicit context passing to cleanly add technical 
        context with remote method invocations (e.g. to add a 
        security principal or the sub-company on whose behalf a 
        request is being made)
        
    * A light daemon manager service for critical daemons
    
    * Various other improvements
    
      * Make the active beans and their configuration visible in JMX
      
      * A light exception handling framework that implements a safety facade
      
      * Packaging and little enhancements of Spring RCP
