Contains the types used to configure a GUI.

<p>TODO: provide lengthy example (e.g. RefDbGui.java)

<p>Gui configuration using this package follows the building block methaphor:
The user is expected to build his GUI by plugging pre-manufactured GUI elements
together. The building blocks used (hereafter called elements) are instantiated
by the user and may subsequently be configured by updating their public fields.
Once configuration is complete, elements verify their configuration's integrity
and are displayed as requested.

<p>There is a one-to-one relationship
between elements and widgets; an element is most conveniently reused by 
putting its configuring code in a subclass and instantiating that class several
times.

<p>Configuring an element's properties is often most conveniently done in a 
subclass (since there is no need to repeat the receiver for each assignment). 
Typically, these subclasses are not reused and require no parameters. We 
therefore recommend the use of anonymous classes and instance initializers. 
Also, these classes rarely declare additional members. We have therefore 
found it most useful to skip an identation level and to nest classes freely:

// TODO: add relevant except from RefDbGui.java

<p>An element's configurable fields are called properties. Properties are set 
at configuration time, later updates typically have no effect. Nevertheless, 
some properties (e.g. an edit view's active bean) represent mutable aspects 
of a component. Instead of directly installing a value into these fields, we
merely install a value holder, whose value is permitted to change at display
time. Since changes must be propagated to the widgets, these holders are of type
{@link util.Observable}. Note that it is permitted to install the same observable 
in various fields to represent common state:

<pre>new Table(Person.class) {{
	filter = personSearch.query;
}}</pre>

More complex depedencies among such properties can be expressed using
{@link util.Rule}.

<h3>Implementation Note</h3>
Since elements must create objects usually managed by a Spring Context, a
lightweight non-factory substitute Spring Context is provided to them at 
verification time.
