Personal TODO list

- deal with double signed jars:
  + ignore them (patch sent to jira, jar plugin (MJAR-24)
  - remove signatures (patch in local svn, need to cleanup and submit, then refactor for MJAR-26)
  See emails
  + follow up MJAR-21 to MJAR-24
  - basically follow up MJAR-25
+ change path for default location of template and resources (patch to clean)
- do not do in place pack200 (patch to clean)
- ENH add default templates and allow user to specify a templateId.
- make sure user can specify user/password sign information on the command line
  - what about a way to put that info inside settings.xml? (this should be achievable using properties. Add doc section)
- document best practises (unsign jars outside of the webstart build, ...)
+ fix broken "Main Class" jar auto detection (should be fixed)
- JnlpReportMojo.java
- Rewrite the pack200 support (do not depend on pack200 ant tasks, they seem unsupported).
- make sure pack200-jdk15 are have correct groupId and artifactId
- conform with http://mojo.codehaus.org/development/guidelines.html
- show an example of template from the docs.
