Reference Projects

  Within ELCA, EL4J has been used for 16 projects so far. The project sizes
  and domains vary a lot. They include a soft real-time application to supervise
  vehicles, several administration-support applications of the public and 
  private sector or an user-interface for a bi-temporal database.
